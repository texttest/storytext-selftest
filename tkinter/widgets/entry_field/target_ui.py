#This sample program is written as a class. The constructor(the ___init__
#method) is called with a parent widget, to which it adds a
#number of child widgets. The constructor starts by creating a Frame widget.
#A frame is a simple container, and is in this case used to hold the
#button and entry widgets.


from Tkinter import *


class App:
	def __init__(self,parent):
		#The frame instance is stored in a local variable 'f'.
		#After creating the widget, we immediately call the 
		#pack method to make the frame visible.

		f = Frame(parent)
		f.pack(padx=15,pady=15)
		
		#we then create an entry widget,pack it and then 
		#create two more button widgets as children to the frame.
    
   		self.entry = Entry(f)
		self.entry.pack(side= TOP,padx=10,pady=12)
                self.entry.insert(0, "your choice")
		
		#this time, we pass a number of options to the
		# constructor, as keyword arguments. The first button
		# is labelled "exit"and the second is labelled "Hello". 
        #Both buttons also take a command option. This option 
		#specifies a function, or (as in this
        #case) a bound method, which will be called when the button is clicked.
		
		self.button = Button(f)
                self.button["text"] = "print"
                self.button["command"] = self.print_this
		self.button.pack(side=BOTTOM,padx=10,pady=10)

		self.exit = Button(f, text="exit", command=f.quit)
		self.exit.pack(side=BOTTOM,padx=10,pady=10)

	def print_this(self):
		print "this is to be printed", self.entry.get()

		#Finally, we provide some script level code that creates
		# a Tk root widget,and one instance of the App class using 
		#the root widget as its parent:

   		#The last call is to the mainloop method on the root widget. It enters the
		#Tk event loop, in which the application will stay until the quit method is
		#called (just click the exit button), or the window is closed.


root = Tk()
root.title('Tkwidgets application')
app = App(root)

root.mainloop()
